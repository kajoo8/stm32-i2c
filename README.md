# stm32-i2c-communication
STM32 project with I2C communication written from scratch. I2C was used to send bytes to a 7-segment LED display. The documentation of LED display was only available in Chinese, so the verification of all segments and bits was also made and packed into functions, so displaying the numbers becomes easier. Finally, after getting samples of air temperature it is displayed on a LED via I2C communication.
