# stm32-i2c-communication
STM32 project with I2C communication written from scratch.

I2C was used to send bytes to a 7-segment LED display. The documentation of LED display was only available in Chinese and for this reason the verification of all segments and bits was also made, so displaying the desired characters becomes easier. Finally, after getting samples of air temperature it is displayed on a LED via I2C communication.

The full documentation of job done is only available in Polish because it was done for my academic project. The most usefull functions are available in separate folder for viewing and whole project is uploaded into another folder which is ready to be used with Eclipse.
